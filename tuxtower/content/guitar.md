# My Guitar Progress

The following is an archive of all my guitar recordings. I officially started to practice guitar properly in early 2021. I have since taken a break from practising but I pick it up every know and then to play some songs that I remember off by heart. My music taste naturally evolves into math rock/midwest emo the more I play. I've also forgotten to play a lot of these songs because I tend to jump around tunings a lot. But most of these songs are played in either DAEAC#E or FACGCE. Videos are ordered from latest to oldest.
