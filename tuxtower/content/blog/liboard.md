# Chess

Recently I got back into playing chess online. I hadn't played in a few years and when I did, it was mainly casually. I would play a couple games if I was bored and that was that. As I was playing over these past weeks, I've thought to myself if only I could play online chess over the board.

When I was younger, my uncle taught me how to play chess. I learnt the fundamentals and ended up joining my primary school chess club. I loved competing in interschool because it was a way for me to compete over the board. I loved physically picking up the pieces and viewing the game from an over-the-board perspective rather than computer chess which is mainly in a 2D layout. If only there was a way to play on a physical board with people online. That's when I came acros DGT boards

## DGT Boards
A DGT board is an electronic chess board that connect to a computer to record in real-time the inputs made during game play. These boards are often used in tournaments to monitor or broadcast the game. You can connect these boards to websites like [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) to use them as input devices. That way you can play online against other players over a physical board.

The only downside to these boards is that they can cost a lot of money. The cheapest board I could find was a (Bluetooth e-board from DGT)[https://gambitchesssupplies.com.au/22010-dgt-pegasus-bluetooth-online-chess-board/]. But the size of the pieces and the board are much smaller than a tournament style chess board. If you wanted one that is closer to tournament style like this (Wooden Smart Board)[https://gambitchesssupplies.com.au/22023-25008-27011-dgt-usb-smart-board-home-use/], it can cost you almost $900!

## Liboard
I came across this cool project (Liboard)[https://liboard.github.io/] which is a DIY electronic chessboard which uses photoresistors to determine where the pieces are. You can connect the board to Lichess and use it to play games online which is exactly what I want. The project provides a wiring schematic and images of the build along with a materials list. This materials list was significantly cheaper than purchasing a DGT board, with it only costing around $50. So I ordered all the parts from Aliexpress and set out to build it!

## Building the Structure
I opted to build the simplest chess board that was more function over looks. I went to Bunnings and bought the cheapest wood I could get. It cost me a total of $15 for some 3x4's and some plywood.
