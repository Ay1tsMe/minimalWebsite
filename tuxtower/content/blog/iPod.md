# The Smartphone
In today's ever growing world of technology. People are constantly living everyday life with there smartphone. It has been one of, if not the most innovative piece of technology to come out of the last century. We rely heavily on our smartphones and we don't even realise it. People can't go outside without having to grab there smartphone to tag along with them. Often using the excuse of:

*"Someone may need to call me incase of an emergency!".*

In reality however, it used as a resource to remove yourself from the present. It has become natural at this point to just pull out your phone and check on unneccesary and time-wasting activities that bring you no value to life.

# Being Present

Recently, I have been going out to various locations without my phone such as coffee shops, resturants and supermarkets and instead of scrolling mindlessly through social media or texting someone small talk, I instead take in my surroundings and become present in the moment. The amount of things that just go by in your life and people miss just because they can't get off there screen.

A couple of weeks ago, I was sitting out by the beach just watching the world go by sipping a nice cup of coffee. Two men brought down there kyak to paddle in the water. Along with them they had a dog who was not eager to let his owner paddle away alone on his kyak. His friend desperelty trying to hold the dog from running into the ocean to save his owner from paddling away. He couldn't hold on for much longer and lost grip of the leash. The dog was soaked and was happily swimming alongside his owner in the kayak. It was a funny and quite beautiful site to see.

Things like these moments often go by without much thought. These moments that bring joy to others are hardly noticed nowadays because people are glued to there phones. If I was mindlessly on my phone scrolling through social media or reading up on something that I don't really care about but I'm just reading to keep myself occupied, I would of missed this moment and honestly, I have probably missed many other moments like these just because of the smartphone.

# Where is this going...
Okay, I'm not saying the smartphone was a bad innovation. It defintely has its pros. It makes interconnection much more convienant. I can easily contact someone thousand of miles away from the palm of my hand. I'm not anti-smartphone. But I am pro being present. And if that requires people to sacrifice the conviencance of using there smartphone then I'm all for it. 

That brings me to what I've been doing recently for the past month...

# The iPod
I'm not entirely sure what led to it but I suddenly had an urge do go through some old drawers in my house to see what sort of old technology we had laying around that nobody used. All of the families iPhones and iPad's had been stashed away not being used after they had become slow or just outdated. One device i came across was my parents original iPod. It was a 5th generation iPod with the click wheel. A rush of nostalgia filled my mind. I suddenly remembered many fond memories with this device that other devices nowadays just don't offer. Things like the iPod, Nintendo DSLite or the PS1 are things that come to mind that just make you remember great memories as a kid. Maybe it's because I'm not old enough to appreciate the modern technologies I have currently but besides the point.

I quickly was tempted to get this thing working. I wanted to know if there were any internal components damaged or this was actually usable almost 20 years from the release date. I searched around for an old cable and plugged it into power. Long and behold I faintly see a battery icon indicating its charging. I was truly excited. I wait a couple more hours for it to charge until it becomes usable to my suprise, all the original songs from my childhood were on there and working. I plugged in some old headphones and everything seemed to work besides a hard to press center button which was a bit annoying to press but was usable.

I found the iPod as a new oppurtunity to sacrifice a part of my smartphone and replace it with something for local and personal to me. Music is also another thing that people don't often appreciate nowadays. People will just pick a song on Spotify and have it in the background while they do other activities like driving or working out at the gym. People don't regurly sit down and listen to albums anymore, or for that matter sit down and take in what a song is actually portraying. 

As I started to use my iPod for regular music listening, I found myself actually taking in the music. I will sometimes sit thirty or so minutes just listening to an album or some songs I really enjoy on my iPod. This is probably placibo but for some reason, listening to music on the iPod just sounds better. It feels more local and personal and the music connects to me on a different level than if I was to play it on my smartphone or computer. There is just something about having songs locally on your iPod that makes you feel like you own it rather than having a Spotify subscripition that goes away the second you don't pay for it.

# The Upgrade
A couple weeks pass at this point and I decide I want to upgrade my iPod so I can maximise my music library. As the first few weeks pass, every couple of days I would go through songs or artists I enjoy from the 60s to 90s era and add them to my iPod. As my music library grew, my avilible storage capacity began to shrink. Given the storage of my iPod was 30gb, I was only able to store around 2000 songs. This sounds like a lot but trust me, it gets full pretty fast. I researched and found there was actually a community that upgrade and tinker with the classic iPods. I researched for about a week and I think I found exactly what I wanted. 

The goal was to have my iPod able to store more songs and also have a better battery life (the old battery would only last a couple hours of playback) while also retaining that same cosmetic look of the iPod. I didn't to upgrade any backplates or buttons or any or those sorts of things because I still wanted the original housing of the iPod due to my history and connection with the device. If I were to upgrade it cosmetically, I feel I would have lost that spark that it has. 

I opted for a iFlash quad micro SD adpater that replaces the original hard drive in the iPod. Alongside that, I also purchased a 3000mAh battery to replace the old 900 or so mAh battery that was inside. Both these products came to a total of $100 AUD which is not as bad as I was expecting. After makng this upgrade, I've been happily dailing driving my 500gb iPod 5th gen for over a month now. It has helped me keep me less occupied on my phone and more on music which I think is more beneficial for my everyday life than using my smartphone instead. 

Below is the video of be dissassembling and resassembling the iPod with the upgrades. If you wan't to follow along how to upgrade these parts then this video should enough to achieve this:
